-- How To Play --
To start playing, simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. The game follows the traditional Tic Tac Toe rules where two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. 
The objective is to be the first player to achieve a row, column, or diagonal of their chosen symbol, which can be either X or O. 
If all spaces are filled without any player achieving a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.
